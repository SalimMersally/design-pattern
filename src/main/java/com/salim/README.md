## What are Design Patterns

Design patterns are solutions to common occurring problems in software engineering. A design pattern is a not a ready solution that you can put directly in your code, rather it is more like a template or blueprint that you can follow to solve the problem in an efficient and organized way.

Design patterns are used in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), they typically specify relationship and interaction between classes or objects.

## Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software

Also known as Gangs of Four (GoF) Design Patterns, is the most popular book on design pattern and is considered as a reference for software engineers. It was written and publish in 1994 by four famous C++ software engineers. 
The book contains 23 design patterns decided into 3 categories:
* Creational: deal with the creation of an object.
* Structural: deals with the class structure.
* Behavioral: deals with interaction between objects.
