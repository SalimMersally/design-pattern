# Intro to Behavioral
Behavioral design patterns are a category of design patterns in object-oriented programming that deal with communication
between objects and the assignment of responsibilities among them. They describe how objects interact with each other 
and how they behave in different situations. Behavioral design patterns help to promote loose coupling, high cohesion, 
and flexibility in software design.
